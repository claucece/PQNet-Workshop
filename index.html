    The past years have witnessed the advances of post-quantum cryptography (PQC)
    as part of the on-going NIST competition in order to provide protection against
    quantum adversaries. But, one of the most challenging aspects that we are
    currently facing is how to integrate these algorithms into the networks,
    protocols and systems that we use today.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Post-Quantum and Networks workshop serves to bring together the industry,
    academia and standardization bodies to think about the task of integrating
    post-quantum algorithms to networks and systems we use today. It aims
    to think around it from an efficiency, usability, deployability, and privacy
    perspective. It aims to highlight the importance and challenges of deploying
    these algorithms into real-world networks, as well as of standardizing these
    complex cryptographic protocols.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first edition of the workshop focuses on current efforts to integrate
    into protocols by looking at the what is proposed for a post-quantum TLS 1.3,
    DNSSEC or VPNs. It also aims to start the conversation around what challenges
    are there when putting post-quantum algorithms into secure messaging or TLS
  	1.3, by holding panels with experts from different areas.
